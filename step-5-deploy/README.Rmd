# minifying

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of minifying is to provide a minifying application for CSS, JS, JSON and HTML files. 

It can be installed from GitHub with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("Colinfay/minifying", subdir = "step-4-strengthen")
```

And then run with: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
minifying::run_app()
```
